    "Volatility scaling can be incorporated with DRL to trade futures contracts [48]. By adding a market volatility term to reward functions, we can scale up the trade shares with low volatility, and vice versa.  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While we attempted to implement this with FinRL, the required modifications proved to be outside the scope of this project.  \n",
    "This was primarily due to:\n",
    " - Architectural Limitations of FinRL Environments: We encountered challenges with the existing environment's design, finding it less modular, difficult to debug, and cumbersome to modify for advanced features.\n",
    " - Dynamic Aggregation Needs: Implementing rolling aggregations on agent returns – which are inherently sequential and cannot be pre-calculated – posed significant performance and integration hurdles within FinRL's current structure.\n",
    " - Complexity of Market Factors: Our evolving understanding of the nuanced factors that truly drive financial market dynamics also played a role in prioritizing core functionalities over this advanced approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this attempt is essentially the same as before with small change. To run it do:\n",
    "1. go to config.py  in this dir\n",
    "2. open it for edit\n",
    "3. change `ENV_TYPE = 'stocks'` to  `ENV_TYPE = 'futures'`  \n",
    "4. restart this notebook \n",
